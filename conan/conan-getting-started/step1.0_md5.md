Let’s get started with an example:

We are going to create an MD5 encrypter app that uses one of the most popular C++ libraries: [Poco](https://pocoproject.org/).

We’ll use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as build system in this case but keep in mind that Conan works with any build system and is not limited to using CMake.

Don't worry about Conan commands used during this example, we will study all of them during this scenario.
