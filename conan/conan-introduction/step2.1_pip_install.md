Enough theory, let's install Conan!

Conan provides different ways to get installed, but the recommended way is to use Python pip. This Ubuntu system already has Python3 and `pip` preinstalled, so the following command will perform the installation automatically.

#### Instructions

1. Let's install Conan running `pip install conan`{{execute}}
2. Check which version did we install with `conan --version`{{execute}}
3. Check the standard help by calling `conan --help`{{execute}}
