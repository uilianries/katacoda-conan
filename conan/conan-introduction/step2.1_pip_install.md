Enough theory, let's install Conan!

Conan provides different ways to get installed, but the recommended way is to use Python pip. This Ubuntu system already has Python3 and `pip` preinstalled, so the following command will perform the installation automatically.

[*] Instructions

[] 1. `pip install conan`{{execute}}
[] 2. Check which version did we install: `conan --version`{{execute}}
[] 3. Check the standard help: `conan`{{execute}}
