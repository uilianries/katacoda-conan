Enough theory, let's install Conan!

Conan provides different ways to get installed, but the recommended way is to use Python pip. This Ubuntu system already has Python3 and Pip preinstalled, so the following command will perform the install automatically:
* `yes | pip install conan`{{execute}}

Let's try it out:
* Which version did we install: `conan --version`{{execute}}
* Standard help: `conan`{{execute}}
