Conan can be installed in many Operating Systems. It has been extensively used and tested in Windows, Linux (different distros), OSX, and is also actively used in FreeBSD and Solaris SunOS. There are also several additional operating systems on which it has been reported to work.

There are three ways to install Conan:

* The preferred and strongly recommended way to install Conan is from PyPI, the Python Package Index, using the pip command.
* There are other available installers for different systems, which might come with a bundled python interpreter, so that you donâ€™t have to install python first. Note that some of these installers might have some limitations, specially those created with pyinstaller (such as Windows exe & Linux deb).
* Running Conan from sources.
