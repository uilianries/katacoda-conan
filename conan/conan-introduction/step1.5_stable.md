From Conan 1.0, there is a commitment to stability, not breaking user space while evolving the tool and the platform. This means:

- Moving forward to following minor versions 1.1, 1.2, â€¦, 1.X should never break existing recipes, packages or command line flows
- If something is breaking, it will be considered a bug and reverted
- Bug fixes will not be considered breaking, recipes and packages relying on the incorrect behavior of such bug will be considered already broken.
- Only documented features are considered part of the public interface of Conan. Private implementation details, and everything not included in the documentation is subject to change.
- *conanfile.py* recipes should be defined according to the documentation in [conanfile.py](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/conanfile.html#conanfile-reference)
- Configuration and automatic tools detection, like the detection of the default profile might be subject to change. Users are encouraged to define their configurations in profiles for repeatability. New installations of conan might use different configuration.

The compatibility is always considered forward. New APIs, tools, methods, helpers can be added in following 1.X versions. Recipes and packages created with these features will be backwards incompatible with earlier conan versions.

This means that public repositories, like conan-center assume the use of the latest version of the Conan client, and using an older version may result in failure of packages and recipes created with a newer version of the client.

Additionally, starting in version 1.6, we began the process of deprecating Python2 support.  Features already working with python2 will continue to do so, but new ones may require Python3.
