Before we are diving into Conan let's make ourselves familiar with the environment we're working in.

On the right side you see an editor window and a terminal. This is a normal Ubuntu-based system, you can freely navigate through the system and edit files. As you are root-user it's even possible for you to install additional software or reconfigure the system.

All links to files are clickable, so are the terminal commands below.

To get started we have set up a very simple instruction for you.

We want to know how are you and the current data:
* `whoami`{{execute}}
* `date`{{execute}}

As you can see there is no magic going on...
