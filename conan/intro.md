Welcome to the basic Conan tutorial.

The goal is to show you a few examples of how Conan works. The tutorial goes alongside the official docs very well, so feel free to get some background information [there](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/introduction.html). The environment this tutorial takes place in let's you play around a lot, it is encouraged to try things out and get a feeling on what's possible.

This tutorial is meant to show experienced C++ programmers how to use the package manager Conan. Knowledge about C++ and CMake are required. It also helps to be familiar with the Linux command line and Python.
